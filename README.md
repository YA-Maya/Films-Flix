## Films-Flix

FilmFlix was a Python project that I developed to keep track of the films I've watched in my personal collection. As I continue to watch more movies, I look forward to adding more details and expanding my collection. It's an ongoing project that allows me to indulge my passion for film while honing my programming skills.
